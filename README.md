**Global Food Insecurity Prediction**


Food insecurity, the lack of access to sufficient food, remains a critical global issue affecting millions and reflecting a nation's ability to meet basic needs. While previous studies have used machine learning to predict food insecurity, they often lack diverse algorithms, comprehensive data procurement, and global-scale analysis. Our project addresses these gaps by integrating pre-and post-pandemic data from four diverse sources, including food stamps, trade data, and poverty statistics, and applying machine learning models: Prophet, LSTM, ARIMA, and Random Forest, to predict food scarcity trends. Evaluated using MSE, MAE, R² Score, and Explained Variance Score, Random Forest emerged as the most effective model with a 0.98 R² Score and 0.98 Explained Variance Score. This approach provides critical insights into food insecurity, inflation, and economic instability, helping policymakers take proactive measures to mitigate future risks and ensure sustainable food distribution.
